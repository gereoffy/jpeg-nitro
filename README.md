**English** | [Magyar](README.hu.md)

**nitroview** is a very fast image viewer for **macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows and
GNOME/Linux**:

| platform | viewer | build |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 12+, Intel and Apple Silicon | Cocoa + Metal: a universal `nitroview.app` | `make app` / `make dmg` |
| Windows 10+ | Win32 + Direct3D 11: one self-contained `nitroview.exe` | `make windows` (llvm-mingw) |
| Linux with GNOME | GTK 4 + libadwaita: `nitroview-gnome`, also as a Flatpak | `make gnome` / `make flatpak` |

All three are built on three decoders of our own that decode a *single* image on all CPU cores —
although JPEG, PNG and PSD compression are all sequential by design:

| decoder | format | how | time | usual decoders |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **nitrojpeg** | baseline JPEG | speculative parallel Huffman decoding, AVX2 IDCT; bit-exact with libjpeg-turbo | 24 MP photo: **~11 ms** | libjpeg-turbo ~107 ms (1 thread) |
| **nitropng** | PNG (8-bit, non-interlaced) | speculative parallel inflate (back-references into not yet known data resolved later, Adler-32 verified) + "wavefront" filter reversal | 38 real PNGs: **~43 ms** avg. | Wuffs ~171 ms, ImageIO ~318 ms |
| **nitropsd** | Photoshop PSD/PSB (8-bit RGB / gray) | merged image: RLE rows in parallel, ZIP via nitropng's inflate; reads only the merged image of huge layered files | 24 MP RLE: **~5 ms** | ImageIO ~170 ms |

Times on an Intel i9. The decoders are fast on ARM too (NEON): on a 2020 M1 MacBook Air a
24 MP JPEG decodes in ~30 ms, ~3× faster than Apple's hardware JPEG decoder on the same machine
([Apple Silicon](#apple-silicon-m1)). They are plain C files without dependencies and can be
used on their own ([Using the decoders](#using-the-decoders)). Photo series such as timelapses can be "played
back" at full resolution in real time, up to 60 images/s. HEIC, TIFF, WebP, GIF and BMP open
through Apple ImageIO on macOS, WIC on Windows and GTK's loaders on Linux (see **Windows** and
**GNOME / Linux** below). (The name: racing cars boost the turbo with nitro.)

Developed and measured on an Intel x86-64 Mac (i9 13th gen, 8 cores / 16 threads, AMD RX 580).
Also runs on Apple Silicon (M1 MacBook Air, see [below](#apple-silicon-m1)); there the IDCT uses NEON instead of AVX2.

```
./nitroview [-f] [-s ms] [-j threads] image.jpg ... | directory/
```

| key | action |
|---|---|
| PgDn / Space | next image |
| PgUp / Backspace | previous image |
| Home / End | first / last |
| + / − | zoom in / out (√2 steps, stops exactly at 100% and at fit) |
| 0 | fit to the screen: small images are enlarged too (stays on while paging, until W) |
| 1 | actual size: one image pixel = one screen pixel |
| 2 … 8 | 200% … 800%, pixel-exact: one image pixel = N×N screen pixels |
| ← → ↑ ↓ | move a zoomed image (Shift: half a screen per step) |
| W | back to the image's own size (small images at 100%), window follows image sizes again |
| mouse drag | move a zoomed image |
| scroll wheel | zoom around the point under the cursor (one √2 step per notch; trackpad: smooth, pinch too) |
| double click | fit → 100% at the clicked point; again → back to fit |
| right click / Shift + right click | next / previous image |
| Ctrl + scroll wheel | previous (forward) / next (back) image; trackpad: one image per 40 px |
| mouse side buttons (back / forward) | previous / next image |
| F / Enter | toggle full screen (`-f`: start in full screen) |
| P | pause / resume the slideshow |
| Esc / Q | quit (Esc in full screen: back to a window) |

**One file given** (e.g. from Midnight Commander or the Finder): paging moves through the other
images of its folder, in Finder order. The folder is listed only on the first paging key, so macOS
asks for folder access only if you actually page.

**Passing the app on:** `make zip` or `make dmg`. The app is only ad-hoc signed, so on another Mac
macOS refuses it the first time: right-click → Open (up to macOS 14), or System Settings → Privacy &
Security → Open Anyway (macOS 15), or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine nitroview.app`. With an Apple
Developer ID it opens without that: `make dmg notarize SIGN_ID="Developer ID Application: Name
(TEAMID)" NOTARY_PROFILE=name` signs it (hardened runtime), has Apple notarize the dmg and staples the
ticket to it (once before: `xcrun notarytool store-credentials name`).

**Finder:** `make app` builds `nitroview.app`. Copy it to /Applications, then in the Finder: Get Info
on an image → Open with → nitroview → Change All. Images or folders can also be dropped on its Dock
icon or its window, or chosen with nitroview → Open… (⌘O); a running viewer takes the new file(s).

**Windows:** `nitroview.exe` ([src/nitroview_win.c](src/nitroview_win.c), Win32 + Direct3D 11) is
the same viewer: the same keys, mouse, zoom and window behaviour, full screen, slideshow, one file →
its folder, drag & drop. JPEG / PNG / PSD go through the three decoders and a compute shader,
everything else (progressive JPEG, HEIC, TIFF, WebP, GIF, BMP) through Windows' own WIC codecs.
One self-contained .exe (only system DLLs, Windows 10 or later), built on the Mac or on Linux with
`make windows` (see [Other systems](#using-the-decoders)). `nitroview.exe --register` offers it for
all these types in Explorer (current user, no admin rights) and opens Settings → Default apps, where
you pick it (Windows lets only the user choose the default); `--unregister` removes it again.
Opening files while it runs shows them in the running window (`-n`: a new one). Not there yet:
colour management (images are shown as sRGB); touchpad gestures are untested.

**GNOME / Linux:** `nitroview-gnome` ([src/gnome/](src/gnome), GTK 4 + libadwaita, contributed by
Ferenc Czirok) has the same keys, mouse and trackpad gestures, zoom and pan, full screen, slideshow
(`-s`), one file → its folder, drag & drop and an Open dialog. JPEG / PNG / PSD go through the three
decoders (as `libnitro.so`); the JPEG colour conversion is multi-threaded and gives exactly
libjpeg-turbo's RGB (`bench/rgbverify`), PNG rows go to GTK without a copy, and the EXIF
orientation is applied when drawing. Images are decoded on a background thread with the same
prefetch as on macOS / Windows (3 ahead, 2 behind). Everything else (progressive JPEG, TIFF, GIF,
WebP ...) is opened by GTK's own loaders. The window keeps its size while paging (under Wayland an
application doesn't resize its own window freely). `make gnome` needs GTK 4.10+ and libadwaita 1.4+;
`make gnome-register` adds it to the desktop for the current user; `make flatpak` builds
`nitroview-gnome.flatpak` on the GNOME 50 runtime.

The window is sized to the image: at exactly 100% if it is smaller than the screen, otherwise
with the image's aspect ratio as large as fits (no black bars). When zooming in, the window grows with the image up to the screen
size (and shrinks back when zooming out; 0 restores it). When paging, it follows each image's
size (keeping its centre), except while zoomed in: then the window, zoom and position stay. After you resize the window yourself (edge drag, green button, tiling) it keeps that
size; W brings it back to the image size and turns the automatic sizing back on. The title shows the zoom level right after the file name. Integer zoom levels (200%, 300%,
400%, … also when reached with the wheel or +/−) show the pixels as exact square blocks;
other levels are smoothly interpolated. Paging stops at the first and last image. **Zoom and position are kept when paging**, so in
a burst or series you can zoom into a detail (e.g. the eyes) and page through to find the
sharpest shot. Wheel zoom keeps the point under the cursor in place, except while the image is narrower
than the window along an axis: it stays centred there until it fills the window. If Ctrl + scroll zooms the whole screen instead, macOS Accessibility zoom is set to use
Ctrl with the scroll gesture (System Settings → Accessibility → Zoom). If pinching does nothing, the
gesture is turned off (System Settings → Trackpad → Scroll & Zoom → Zoom in or out). The zoom keys work by character, so they work on any keyboard layout and the
numeric keypad; the title shows the current zoom. The window title shows the file name, size and
decode time; stdout gets one line per image with read time, decode time and the
key → on-screen latency. EXIF orientation is honoured.

**Slideshow:** `-s <ms>` (or `--slideshow <ms>`): the next image comes when the current one
has been on screen for `ms` milliseconds (`-s 2000` is a classic slideshow, `-s 40` is
~25 images/s). If an image takes longer to load, it waits, so no image is skipped. It stops
at the last image; P pauses; the paging keys keep working and the slideshow continues from
there. Timing follows the display refresh (±8 ms at 60 Hz). Run without arguments (or `-h`)
for the full list of options.

**Other formats:** besides JPEG, nitroview opens PNG, PSD/PSB, HEIC/HEIF, TIFF, WebP, GIF and BMP.
PSD/PSB: the merged (composite) image is shown, decoded by **nitropsd** for 8-bit RGB and
grayscale files (all four compressions: raw, RLE, ZIP, ZIP with prediction), otherwise by Apple
ImageIO — which cannot read ZIP-compressed PSDs at all. A 24 MP RLE PSD decodes in ~5 ms
(ImageIO: ~170 ms), ZIP in ~46 ms: the RLE row table gives every row's position, so all rows
are unpacked in parallel; ZIP uses nitropng's parallel inflate. Big layered PSDs are mostly layer
data (the merged image is often only 13–23% of the file), so the viewer reads just the header,
the image resources (ICC profile) and the merged image: a 482 MB PSD loads in ~20 ms instead of
~155 ms.
Merged transparency (negative layer count): Photoshop stores the colour matted with white — in a
test file every partially transparent pixel had every channel ≥ 255 − alpha — so nitropsd shows it
over black as max(0, colour + alpha − 255). ImageIO does not remove the matte (light fringes on
soft edges). A 4th channel with a positive layer count is a saved selection, not transparency.
Files saved without "Maximize Compatibility" contain only a white placeholder instead of the merged
image; the layers are not composited, so they show white (as in ImageIO). On 55 real PSDs
(Photoshop work, maps, architecture) the result matches ImageIO except for these two points. PNG is decoded by **nitropng**, our own parallel PNG decoder
(8-bit gray / RGB / RGBA, non-interlaced: most PNGs), otherwise by
[Wuffs](https://github.com/google/wuffs) when it is available (`scripts/get-deps.sh`) or by
Apple ImageIO like the other formats. Transparent images are shown over black. On 38 real PNGs
(screenshots, scans, AI images, upscaled textures, Photoshop exports) nitropng averages
**~43 ms/image** vs ~171 ms for Wuffs and ~318 ms for ImageIO; see [nitropng](#nitropng).

**Colour management:** embedded ICC profiles are honoured for every format (e.g. Display P3
from iPhones and Mac screenshots, Adobe RGB scans); images without a profile are treated as
sRGB. The decoded pixel values are left as they are and the display layer is tagged with the
image's colour space, so macOS converts to the monitor's profile at no extra cost and wide-gamut
colours are kept.

`-j N` limits the decoder to N threads (default: all logical CPUs). With 8 threads decoding
takes ~15.4 ms/image instead of 11.8, but heats the CPU less.

Other modes:
- `--bench files…`: load everything without a window (read, decode, GPU) and print timings.
- `--selftest files…`: compare the GPU colour conversion with libjpeg-turbo's output.
- `--zoomtest files…`: replays zoom/pan key sequences offscreen and checks that at 100% every
  drawn pixel equals the decoded image (plus edge clamping and zoom snapping).
- `--inputtest files…`: sends synthesized mouse and wheel events and checks paging and zoom.
- `--auto <ms>`: test mode: pages every `ms` (even if the image isn't shown yet) and quits
  at the end. For latency measurements.

## Results (50 photos, mostly 6000×4000, 17 MB on average)

**Full load in the viewer: ~23 ms/image** (file read 3.5 + decode 12 + GPU 7).
When paging, a prefetched image reaches the screen in **7–20 ms** (one frame at 60 Hz).
A folder of 24 MP images plays back continuously at **~60 images/s** (the display refresh
rate), also from an SSD with nothing cached.

### Decoder comparison (`bench/bench`, decode only, from memory)

| decoder | ms/image |
|---|---|
| Apple ImageIO (CGImageSource) → BGRA | 274 |
| Apple ImageIO, native buffer | 249 |
| stb_image | 175 |
| Wuffs | 159 |
| ImageIO thumbnail 3000 px (DCT scaling) | 159 |
| VideoToolbox (JPEG; no HW JPEG on this machine, runs in software) | 157 |
| libjpeg-turbo 3.1.2 (AVX2), BGRX | 124 |
| libjpeg-turbo, fast DCT + fast upsampling | 112 |
| libjpeg-turbo → YUV planes (no colour conversion) | 107 |
| libjpeg-turbo, 1/2 scale | 100 |
| libjpeg-turbo, 1/4 scale | 96 |
| nitrojpeg, own engine, **1 thread** → YUV | 103 |
| nitrojpeg, old engine (libjpeg-turbo decodes the bands) → YUV | 20.6 |
| **nitrojpeg, own engine, parallel → YUV planes** (used by the viewer) | **11.7** |

1/4 scale barely helps, so most of the time goes into Huffman decoding, which is
inherently sequential in JPEG. Most camera JPEGs have no restart markers, so libjpeg-turbo
can't parallelise within one image. The RX 580 has no hardware JPEG decoder.

### Apple Silicon (M1)

A 2020 M1 MacBook Air (4 performance + 4 efficiency cores, no fan), `bench/bench` on 43 of the
photos (`samples/*.JPG`, 765 MB), ms/image. Raw output, also with the i9 on the same 43 files:
`bench/results/m1.txt`.

| decoder | ms/image |
|---|---|
| stb_image | 384 |
| Wuffs | 217 |
| libjpeg-turbo, BGRX | 185 |
| libjpeg-turbo → YUV planes | 168 |
| Apple ImageIO → BGRA | 108 |
| Apple ImageIO, native buffer | 89 |
| VideoToolbox | 88 |
| ImageIO thumbnail 3000 px | 67 |
| nitrojpeg, **1 thread** → YUV | 154 |
| **nitrojpeg, parallel → YUV** | **30.4** |

On the M1, ImageIO and VideoToolbox decode JPEG in hardware: 2.5–3× faster than the software
path on the i9 (table above). nitrojpeg (NEON IDCT, 8 threads) is still ~3× faster than that
hardware at full size and 5.5× faster than libjpeg-turbo. One M1 core is ~1.5× slower than an i9
core on this work (1 thread: 154 ms, the i9 103 ms in the table above); the threads scale well: 2 → 81 ms, 4 → 46 ms, from 6 on 33–36 ms (the four
efficiency cores add roughly one performance core). The NEON IDCT brought 8 threads from 43 to
31 ms. The default (one thread per core, 8) is the best setting there.

PNG (`bench/pngbench samples_png/real/*.png`: 34 real PNGs, 938 MB, 805 Mpixel — screenshots,
scans, AI images, maps; ms/image):

| decoder | M1 | i9 |
|---|---|---|
| Apple ImageIO, native buffer | 364 | 345 |
| Apple ImageIO → BGRA | 392 | 376 |
| Wuffs → BGRA | 272 | 180 |
| nitropng, 1 thread | 326 | 223 |
| **nitropng, parallel** | **90** | **45.5** |

There is no hardware PNG decoder, so ImageIO is equally slow on both. On the M1 nitropng is 3×
faster than Wuffs and 4× faster than ImageIO. Its Adler-32 and back-reference resolving use NEON
there (AVX2 on x86): that took it from ~100 to 90 ms; most of the time is Huffman decoding
and the row filters, which are plain C on both.

### Three machines, macOS and Linux

`bench/nbench` (portable, same code on every system), best of 5 decodes, ms/image; JPEG: the 50
sample photos, PNG: the 34 real PNGs above. The M1 row is from `bench/bench` / `bench/pngbench`
(JPEG: 43 of the photos).

| machine | JPEG, parallel | JPEG, 1 thread | PNG, parallel | PNG, 1 thread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intel i9 13th gen, 8 cores / 16 threads, macOS | **8.7** | 96 | **37.6** | 216 |
| Apple M1, 4 + 4 cores, macOS | **30.4** | 154 | **90** | 326 |
| Intel Xeon E3-1245 v5 (2015), 4 cores / 8 threads, Linux | **33.6** | 161 | **122** | 390 |

On Linux the decoders run on the pthread pool of `src/nitro_os.h` and are bit-exact there too
(`bench/verify`, `bench/pngverify`). A ten-year-old 4-core server decodes a 24 MP photo in
~34 ms, like the M1; hyper-threading adds ~20% for JPEG (4.8× on 4 cores), little for PNG (3.1×).

Intel Core i7-1260P (4 P + 8 E cores / 16 threads, Arch Linux, 64 GB RAM), `bench/nbench`,
best of 5 decodes on a different image set (4 JPEGs, 5 PNGs): JPEG **5.4 ms** parallel /
32.3 ms on 1 thread; PNG **13.4 ms** / 35.4 ms. A 12000×12000 (144 MP) RLE PSD:
**68.2 ms** / 112.4 ms on 1 thread. The image set differs from the table above, so these
numbers are not directly comparable with its three rows.

On the same machine, best of 5 on one 6000×6000 JPEG and one 2000×1970 PNG:

| decoder | JPEG | PNG |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Nitro** | **14.8 ms** | **12.9 ms** |
| Glycin 2.1.0 load + frame | 184.5 ms | 37.6 ms |

That is **12.5×** for JPEG and **2.9×** for PNG. Nitro is `bench/nbench` decode time;
the Glycin number includes `gly_loader_load()` + `gly_image_next_frame()`.

### How nitrojpeg parallelises a single image

The Huffman stream is decoded **once**, without libjpeg-turbo:

1. **Preparation (parallel, ~1 ms):** find the end of the entropy-coded data, remove byte
   stuffing (0xFF 0x00) and restart markers, giving a "clean" bit stream.
2. **Files without restart markers: speculative full decoding.** The bit stream is cut into
   ~512 chunks (`32 × CPUs`, ~200 KB of coefficients each, which fits in L2). Every chunk is
   decoded by a thread that starts at an arbitrary byte offset, writing coefficients right
   away. Huffman codes self-synchronise with the true decoding path after a few MCUs.
3. **Stitching, in order, pipelined.** When the true path starts an MCU at a bit position
   that the next chunk also recorded as an MCU start, both paths are identical from there.
   This gives the chunk's MCU index and per-component DC offset; the few MCUs before the
   sync point are discarded.
4. **Dequantisation + IDCT** with AVX2. The algorithm is libjpeg's "ISLOW" IDCT (jidctint.c),
   so the output is bit-identical. As soon as a chunk is stitched, the thread that decoded it
   runs its IDCT while the coefficients are still in cache.
5. **Files with restart markers:** no speculation; the intervals are decoded in parallel with
   the IDCT done per MCU right away.
6. The output is planar Y/Cb/Cr, written directly into a Metal (shared) buffer. Upsampling
   and YCbCr→RGB run in a GPU compute kernel, the GPU builds mipmaps, and the image is drawn
   with trilinear filtering.

Measured synchronisation (`bench/verify`, 512 chunks, first 256 sync points per image,
40 images = 10240 cases): on average a chunk joins the true path after 2.40 "garbage" MCUs
(~922 bits, ~115 bytes). In 40% of the cases after 1 MCU; the worst case was 21 MCUs
(8754 bits), and synchronisation never failed.

**Accuracy:** the parallel output is **bit-identical** to single-threaded libjpeg-turbo on all
50 test images (`bench/verify`, with both the scalar and the AVX2 IDCT). The GPU colour
conversion differs by at most ±1 (rounding, `--selftest`). Unsupported files (progressive,
CMYK, RGB, >16384 px) and damaged files fall back to TurboJPEG in the viewer.

### How it got there (ms/image, 16 threads)

| version | ms/image |
|---|---|
| libjpeg-turbo, 1 thread | 107 |
| speculative skip pass + libjpeg-turbo decodes 128 re-emitted "band" JPEGs (Huffman twice) | 19.9 |
| same, but a single-threaded Huffman pass instead of speculation (`NJ_SEQ=1`, old engine) | 67.2 |
| own engine: Huffman once, coefficients kept in memory, then IDCT | 15.7 |
| + single-lookup AC decoding, pipeline: IDCT while the chunk is in cache | **11.7** |

The single-threaded Huffman pass is slow because it is a serial dependency chain: the length
of each code must be known before the next one can be read (~12 cycles/symbol). Without the
pipeline, the IDCT was memory-bound: writing and re-reading the 96 MB coefficient array
saturated at ~45 GB/s and did not scale beyond 8 threads.

Chunk count (`NJ_CHUNKS`), ms/image:

| chunks | 64 | 128 | 256 | 512 | 1024 | 2048 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ms/image | 12.3 | 12.0 | 11.9 | **11.4** | 12.1 | 14.7 |

Measurements of the old engine (libjpeg-turbo bands, `nj_set_engine(1)`, `NJ_ENGINE=1`) are in
`bench/results/matrix.txt` (chunks × threads) and `bench/results/bands.txt` (band count).

### Measurement method: clock speed and temperature

The development machine's clock jumps between 4 and 5.5 GHz and the CPU passes 90 °C within
seconds under 16-thread load, so a single measurement can be off by ±10%.

- `bench/freqprobe [threads] [seconds]`: measures the real core clock without root (a chain
  of dependent adds runs at one add per cycle). Measured: 4.48 GHz single-threaded from idle
  (the scheduler raises the clock slowly), ~4.95 GHz with 16 threads, ~5.3 GHz with 8.
- `bench/sustain SECONDS THREADS files…`: continuous decoding, speed + clock every 0.5 s.
  Over 30 s with 16 threads there is no downward trend (10.1–11.9 ms/image), so the cooling
  holds; the spread comes from clock jumps, not throttling.
- `bench/ab.sh REPS PAUSE -- "name:ENV=value" …`: runs variants interleaved, with a cool-down
  pause and a clock measurement before each run; prints median / min / max. This keeps the
  min–max spread within about ±3%.

Re-measured this way (5 repetitions, 3 s pause, ms/image, `bench/results/ab_results.txt`):

| comparison | median (min–max) |
|---|---|
| own engine / old engine (libjpeg-turbo bands) | **11.8** (11.8–11.9) / 19.8 (19.5–20.8) |
| 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 threads | 27.0 / 15.4 / 12.3 / **11.8** |
| 256 / 512 / 1024 chunks | 11.9 / **11.7** / 12.2 (overlapping ranges: within noise) |

### nitropng

PNG = deflate (LZ77 + Huffman) + per-row filters, both sequential by design:

1. **Parallel inflate (speculative, like *pugz*):** the compressed stream is cut into one chunk
   per thread. Every thread finds the first valid deflate block header in its chunk (Huffman
   tables must be exactly complete, so false positives are rare and get rejected anyway) and
   decodes from there. Back-references into the still unknown 32 KB before the chunk are written
   as placeholders (16-bit symbols). The chunks are chained in order; only the last 32 KB of each
   need to be resolved sequentially, the rest in parallel (AVX2). The Adler-32 of the whole
   output (combined from per-chunk sums, AVX2) must match, otherwise the viewer falls back.
2. **Parallel filter reversal ("wavefront"):** None / Sub rows are independent; Up / Average /
   Paeth rows follow the previous row segment by segment (1 KB), on 12 of the 16 threads
   (waiting hyper-threads would slow down their working siblings).
3. The unfiltered rows go straight to the GPU, which reads them in place (skipping the filter
   byte), premultiplies alpha and converts to RGBA — no CPU colour conversion.

`bench/pngverify` checks the output byte-for-byte against zlib + a straightforward filter
reversal (all 33 supported test PNGs identical), `bench/pngrobust` runs damaged PNGs with ASan +
UBSan (no errors), `--selftest` checks the whole path against ImageIO (pixel-exact).

### PNG: why it was not parallel

`bench/pngbench` (decoders) and `bench/pngsplit` (where the time goes), on 24 MP photos saved
as PNG:

| decoder | ms/image |
|---|---|
| Apple ImageIO | 339 |
| Wuffs | 193 |
| zlib inflate alone | 91 |
| filter reversal alone (plain C) | 67–134 |

PNG is deflate (LZ77 + Huffman with per-block tables) plus per-row filters. A thread starting
in the middle of the stream does not know the previous 32 KB of output that back-references
point to, and 97% of the rows used the Paeth filter, which depends on the previous row. Both
can be parallelised in principle: speculative inflate with placeholder back-references resolved
later (as in *pugz*), and a "wavefront" filter reversal where row *r* trails row *r−1*. That
could bring a 24 MP PNG to perhaps 20–40 ms (the estimate at the time — see nitropng above
for what it became).

### Damaged files

When the decoder detects an error (invalid Huffman code, coefficient index overrun, the last
MCU ends past the end of the data, wrong number of restart markers, …) it gives up, and the
viewer falls back to TurboJPEG, which shows whatever is recoverable (e.g. the top part of a
half-downloaded file), and then to Apple ImageIO (Wuffs is only used for PNG). If nothing can
decode it (unknown format, broken header, empty file), the title shows `CANNOT DECODE` and
paging continues.

`make bench/robust && bench/robust samples/*` creates ~90 damaged variants of every image
(truncation from 0 bytes to length−1, random byte and bit errors, zeroed or 0xFF-filled
blocks, markers inserted into the data, header damage, cut or duplicated sections) plus
garbage and text files, and runs them through the viewer's decode path built with
AddressSanitizer and UBSan: 4372 cases, 0 errors. The pipeline's synchronisation was also
checked with ThreadSanitizer (on valid and damaged files).

### Display and prefetching

- A background thread decodes 3 images ahead in the paging direction and 2 behind, and
  uploads/converts the neighbours on the GPU in advance.
- Metal buffers and textures are reused (allocating the 128 MB texture per image cost ~6 ms).
- A shared (system memory) buffer read directly by the conversion kernel was the fastest
  (8 ms vs 10 ms with managed buffers / textures).
- The decoder's large buffers (clean bit stream, coefficients) are reused from image to image.

## Using the decoders

`src/nitrojpeg.c` + `src/nitrojpeg.h` (+ `src/nitro_os.h`) are self-contained (C, pthreads, optional AVX2 / NEON).
They decode baseline JPEGs (8-bit, Huffman, 1 or 3 components, YCbCr/greyscale, any chroma
subsampling, with or without restart markers) into planar Y/Cb/Cr:

```c
#include "nitrojpeg.h"

}
```

**nitropng** (`src/nitropng.c/.h`) works the same way: `np_read_info()`, then `np_decode()`
into `info.raw_size` bytes — the unfiltered rows, each still preceded by its filter byte
(row y at `out + y * (stride + 1) + 1`). `np_zlib_decompress()` is the parallel inflate on its
own, for any zlib stream of known size. **nitropsd** (`src/nitropsd.c/.h`, needs nitropng):
`ps_read_info()`, then `ps_decode()` writes the planes (R, G, B or gray, then transparency if
`info.alpha`) one after the other.

**Other systems (Linux, MinGW).** The decoders don't depend on macOS: all they need from the OS
is in `src/nitro_os.h` — a parallel loop (Grand Central Dispatch on macOS, a small pthread
pool elsewhere), a clock and the CPU count. The loop bodies are clang blocks (`^(size_t i) {…}`),
so they need **clang with `-fblocks`** (GCC doesn't support blocks); no blocks runtime library is
needed. On Linux, `make` (= `make linux`) builds `build/lib/libnitro.so`,
`build/lib/libnitro.a` and the portable tools: `bench/nbench`, `bench/pngverify`,
`bench/psdverify`, the ASan robustness tests, and `bench/verify` / `bench/robust` after
`scripts/get-deps.sh` (which builds libjpeg-turbo 3 into `third_party/`; the TurboJPEG 3 API
is needed, older system packages don't have it). By hand, for example:

```
clang -O3 -march=native -fblocks -c src/nitrojpeg.c src/nitropng.c src/nitropsd.c
clang -O3 -fblocks bench/pngverify.c src/nitropng.c -lz -lpthread -o pngverify   # byte-exact check vs zlib
clang -O3 -march=native -fblocks bench/nbench.c src/nitrojpeg.c src/nitropng.c src/nitropsd.c -lpthread -o nbench
./nbench -1 photos/*.jpg images/*.png   # speed: best / average ms per file, -1 also single-threaded
```

`bench/nbench` (also `make bench/nbench` on macOS) is the portable benchmark: it reads each JPEG,
PNG or PSD file into memory and decodes it several times (`-r`, default 5), `-j N` limits the
threads.

`make gnome` builds `nitroview-gnome` against `build/lib/libnitro.so` (GTK4 + libadwaita).
It opens JPEG, PNG and PSD/PSB through the Nitro decoders; files can be opened from the command
line, the desktop or the native Open dialog. `make gnome-register` installs the desktop file
and icon for the current user.

On macOS the pthread pool can be tried with `-DNITRO_PTHREAD_POOL`: there it is as fast as GCD
and passes all checks (`verify`, `pngverify`, `psdverify`, the ASan robustness tests,
ThreadSanitizer with four threads decoding at once). Tested on Linux (see
[Three machines](#three-machines-macos-and-linux)).

**Windows:** `make windows WINCC=…/llvm-mingw/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang` cross-compiles
`nitroview.exe` (the viewer, with its icon), `bench/nbench.exe` and `bench/psdverify.exe` with [llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw)
(clang + MinGW-w64; also works in MSYS2's CLANG64): static, only system DLLs, AVX2
(`WINARCH=x86-64-v2` without). `nbench.exe` runs on Windows Server with the same results;
wildcards (`*.jpg`) are expanded by the program, directories work as arguments too.

## Build

Linux: `make linux` builds the shared/static decoder library and portable tools; `make gnome`
builds the GTK4/libadwaita viewer, and `make gnome-register` registers it for the current user.

Requirements on macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools.

```
make                 # nitroview; uses libjpeg-turbo as fallback if it is in third_party/
make TURBOJPEG=0     # no libjpeg-turbo: other JPEGs go to Apple ImageIO
make WUFFS=0         # no Wuffs: PNG via Apple ImageIO (~1.6x slower)
scripts/get-deps.sh  # download + build libjpeg-turbo (macOS: Intel + ARM), stb_image, Wuffs into third_party/ (~30 s)
make app             # nitroview.app for the Finder: universal (Intel + Apple Silicon), macOS 12+,
                     # ad-hoc signed, icon from packaging/icon.png
make zip / make dmg  # nitroview.zip / nitroview.dmg (drag to Applications) for passing it on
make tools           # bench/bench, verify, robust, freqprobe, sustain (needs get-deps.sh)
```

**libjpeg-turbo is optional.** nitrojpeg decodes baseline JPEGs on its own.

- **`TURBOJPEG=1`** (default when `third_party/ljt` exists): progressive, CMYK, RGB, >16384 px
  and damaged files are decoded by TurboJPEG, which also shows what is recoverable from
  damaged images. `--selftest` is only available in this mode.
- **`TURBOJPEG=0`**: those files are decoded by Apple ImageIO instead (slower; damaged files
  that ImageIO can't read show `CANNOT DECODE` and paging continues). Valid baseline images are
  exactly as fast. Without any optional dependency the viewer needs only macOS frameworks.

The parts of nitrojpeg that need libjpeg-turbo are behind `#ifdef NJ_REFERENCE`: the old
engine where libjpeg-turbo decodes the bands, the CPU BGRX output and the single-threaded
pass experiment. Only the tests and benchmarks use them (`build/nitrojpeg_ref.o`). In the
viewer, the fallback decoder is behind `#ifdef NV_TURBOJPEG`.

The tests and benchmarks look for images in `samples/`: put your own JPEGs there (or a
symlink). The measurements above were made on 50 private photos that are not in the repo.

`-march=native` optimises the binary for the CPU it is built on.

## Further optimisation ideas (measured)

**Huffman tables are mostly the same.** Cameras and phones use the example tables of the JPEG
standard (Annex K): all 43 Sony A6300 photos, all 92 iPhone photos and 168 of the 178 Canon 50D
photos (the other 10 were re-saved in Photoshop, which writes optimised tables); of 2341 JPEGs
from the web, 1506 (~2/3) too, the rest mostly have their own optimised tables. Caching the
decoding tables would gain nothing, though: building them takes ~8 µs per image, 0.1–0.4% of the
decode. The time goes into *using* them.

**Multi-symbol tables** (possible with fixed tables, built once): single-threaded Huffman decoding
of 27 Sony photos, ms/image, all outputs identical:

| lookup table | table size | ms/image |
|---|---|---|
| **one symbol, 11 bits (nitrojpeg)** | 8 KB | **104.7** |
| one symbol, 12–16 bits | 16–256 KB | 105–141 |
| up to 3 symbols, 11–16 bits | 32 KB – 1 MB | 110–120 |
| two value symbols, 11–14 bits, else one | 16–128 KB | 103–105 (±1%) |

A 16-bit multi-symbol table yields 2.3 AC symbols per lookup, but it is not faster: the serial
chain (the next code starts where the previous one ended) stays, and the bigger table misses the
L1 cache. AC coefficients are 95.6% of the bits (29.7 non-zero per block in these photos).

**Lookup size in nitrojpeg** (`LOOK`, 8 bytes per entry, 4 tables per image), 43 Sony photos,
average of two interleaved runs, ms/image:

| `LOOK` | tables | parallel (16 threads) | 1 thread |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 8 KB | 11.0 | 110.0 |
| 9 | 16 KB | 10.6 | 106.5 |
| 10 | 32 KB | 10.0 | 98.9 |
| **11** | **64 KB** | **10.0** | **98.3** |
| 12 | 128 KB | 10.1 | 99.4 |
| 13 | 256 KB | 10.5 | 101.0 |
| 14 | 512 KB | 11.2 | 112.4 |
| 15 | 1 MB | 12.4 | 122.4 |
| 16 | 2 MB | 14.4 | 140.4 |

11 bits is the optimum (10–12 is flat): with fewer bits more codes (and code + value pairs) miss
the lookup and take the slow path; with more, the two tables a block uses (DC + AC) no longer
fit the i9's 48 KB L1 cache. The output is bit-exact at every size. With a smaller L1 cache
(Xeon E3-1245 v5, Skylake, 32 KB, Linux) 10, 11 and 12 bits are equal within the noise (1 thread:
~174, ~171, ~173 ms/image), so 11 stays.

A trap on that Xeon: after a few edits that did not touch the Huffman code the parallel decode went from 34 to 40–43 ms,
and 13 bits looked 18% faster. It was code layout, not the table: Skylake-family CPUs (JCC
erratum microcode) drop code from the decoded-uop cache when a jump crosses or ends at a 32-byte
boundary. With clang's `-mbranches-within-32B-boundaries` (now in the Makefile for x86) every
version measures 34 ms at 11 bits (13 bits: 33, but 3% slower on the i9, where the flag changes
nothing).

The best size depends on the CPU (L1 cache, branch layout), so on your machine, especially an
older one, it is worth measuring 8 to 16 instead of the default 11. The size is a compile-time
option; each build stays bit-exact:

```sh
for L in 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16; do make -B DEFS=-DLOOK=$L bench/nbench >/dev/null && printf "LOOK=$L " && bench/nbench -q -r 3 samples/*.jpg | tail -1; done
make -B DEFS=-DLOOK=13       # then build with the winner (DEFS goes into every target)
```

**Lookup size in nitropng** (literal/length table `LBITS`, distance table `DBITS`, 4 bytes per
entry, longer codes in sub-tables), 34 real PNGs, average of two interleaved runs, ms/image:

| `LBITS` | `DBITS` | parallel (16 threads) | 1 thread |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | 8 | 39.0 | 217.5 |
| 10 | 8 | 38.7 | 215.6 |
| **11** | **8** | **39.1** | **214.7** |
| 12 | 8 | 38.9 | 214.2 |
| 13 | 8 | 40.3 | 217.7 |
| 11 | 6 | 38.7 | 214.9 |
| 11 | 7 | 38.8 | 214.4 |
| 11 | 9 | 38.6 | 215.2 |
| 11 | 10 | 38.7 | 215.3 |

All within the noise (±1.5%), only 13 bits is slightly slower; the output is byte-exact at every
size. Unlike JPEG, the size hardly matters: the tables are small (the 11-bit literal table is 8 KB),
the common deflate codes are shorter than 11 bits, and much of the time goes into copying
back-references and reversing the row filters, which don't depend on the tables.

**Progressive JPEG** (not supported, decoded by libjpeg-turbo / WIC / GTK): in 82 progressive
files (6 MP on average) the Y AC refinement scans are ~52% of the bytes and the chain of Y scans
that depend on each other ~80%, so decoding scans / components in parallel would gain only
~1.2–1.3×.
